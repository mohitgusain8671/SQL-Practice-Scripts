# Advanced SQL Theory

This document covers the fundamental architecture of SQL databases and how different types of queries are executed internally.

## SQL Architecture Overview

```
CLIENT --> Query --> SERVER
```

The server contains two main components:

### 1. Database Engine
- The brain of the database
- Executes multiple operations: storing, retrieving, and managing data
- Handles query processing and optimization

### 2. Storage System

#### A. Disk Storage (Long-term Memory)
- **Characteristics:**
  - Permanent data storage
  - Large capacity
  - Slower read/write operations

- **Storage Areas:**
  1. **User Area**: Main database content where actual user data is stored
  2. **Catalog Area**: Metadata storage - blueprint tracking database structure (not user data)
  3. **Temp Area**: Temporary data for current transactions and short-term database tasks

#### B. Cache Storage (Short-term Memory)
- **Characteristics:**
  - Temporary data storage
  - Limited capacity
  - Fast read/write operations

## Query Execution Flow

### Standard Flow (Cache Hit)
```
Client --> Query --> Server --> Database Engine --> Storage --> Cache Storage --> Client
```

### Cache Miss Flow
```
Client --> Query --> Server --> Database Engine --> Storage --> Cache Storage --> Not Found 
--> Database Engine --> Disk Storage --> Query Processing --> Database Engine --> Client
```

## Subquery Execution Patterns

### 1. Subquery in FROM Clause

**Execution Steps:**
1. Client writes query containing main query and subquery
2. Client sends query to server
3. Database Engine executes subquery first
4. Intermediate result stored in cache for faster retrieval
5. Database Engine executes main query using cached subquery result
6. Result sent to client
7. Database Engine cleans intermediate result from cache

### 2. Subquery in SELECT Clause

**Execution Steps:**
1. Client writes query containing main query and subquery
2. Client sends query to server
3. Database Engine executes subquery
4. Subquery result passed directly to main query
5. Database Engine executes main query using subquery result
6. Final result sent to client

### 3. Subquery in WHERE Clause (Comparison Operators)

**Execution Steps:**
1. Client writes query containing main query and subquery
2. Client sends query to server
3. Database Engine executes subquery
4. Subquery result passed to main query for comparison
5. Database Engine executes main query using subquery result
6. Final result sent to client

**Note:** Same execution process applies to logical operators (IN, ALL, ANY)

### 4. Correlated Subquery / EXISTS Correlated Subquery

**Execution Steps:**
1. Client writes query containing main query and correlated subquery
2. Client sends query to server
3. Database processes main query **row by row**
4. For each row, current row data passed to subquery
5. Subquery processes using current row context
6. Subquery result returned to main query for current row
7. If subquery returns result: row included in final result
8. If subquery returns no result: row skipped
9. Process repeats for next row

### 5. Non-Correlated Subquery

**Execution Steps:**
1. Client writes query containing main query and non-correlated subquery
2. Client sends query to server
3. Database processes subquery **once** and stores result in cache
4. Database processes main query using cached intermediate result
5. Final result sent to client
6. Database Engine cleans intermediate result from cache

## Key Differences

| Subquery Type | Execution Frequency | Cache Usage | Performance |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Non-Correlated** | Once | Yes | Better |
| **Correlated** | Per row | No | Slower |

## Stored Procedure Execution Process

### What is a Stored Procedure?
A stored procedure (SP) is a precompiled collection of SQL statements stored in the database that can be executed as a single unit.

### Execution Process

#### 1. Creation Phase
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails (@EmpID INT) 
AS 
BEGIN     
    SELECT Name, Department, Salary      
    FROM Employees      
    WHERE EmployeeID = @EmpID; 
END;
```

#### 2. Compilation & Storage Phase
- Database engine parses the SQL code
- Compiles and optimizes the SQL statements
- Creates and stores execution plan for future use
- Stored procedure is saved in the database catalog

#### 3. Execution Phase (Calling the SP)
```sql
EXEC GetEmployeeDetails @EmpID = 101;
```

**Execution Steps:**
1. Client calls stored procedure with parameters
2. Database engine retrieves precompiled execution plan
3. Parameters are bound to the execution plan
4. Execution plan runs directly (no compilation needed)
5. Result returned to client

### Normal Query vs Stored Procedure Comparison

| Aspect | Normal Query | Stored Procedure (SP) |
|--------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Definition** | Single SQL statement written and executed directly | Collection of SQL statements stored and executed as a unit |
| **Execution** | Compiled and optimized every time it runs | Compiled once, execution plan reused |
| **Performance** | Slower if run repeatedly (compilation each time) | Faster for repetitive tasks (precompiled) |
| **Reusability** | Must be rewritten or copied each time | Can be called multiple times with different parameters |
| **Security** | Vulnerable to SQL injection if directly exposed | Parameters help prevent SQL injection; access controlled |
| **Maintainability** | Harder to maintain (update in multiple places) | Easier to maintain (centralized logic) |
| **Functionality** | Limited to query execution | Supports loops, conditions, error handling, transactions |

## Performance Implications

- **Non-correlated subqueries** are generally more efficient as they execute once
- **Correlated subqueries** can be slower due to row-by-row processing
- **Cache storage** significantly improves performance for repeated data access
- **FROM clause subqueries** benefit most from caching mechanisms
- **Stored procedures** provide best performance for repetitive operations due to precompilation
